        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguini pasta,

        chicken and Cajun seasoning in a bowl, and toss to coat.

      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet over medium heat, saute chicken in butter until no
        longer pink and juices run clear, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add green and
        red bell peppers, sliced mushrooms and green onions; cook for 2 to 3
        minutes. Reduce heat, and stir in heavy cream. Season the sauce with
        basil, lemon pepper, salt, garlic powder and ground black pepper, and
        heat through.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, toss linguini with sauce. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan
        cheese.
